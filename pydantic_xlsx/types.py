    Handles amounts of money by subclassing float. In general it's a very bad
    idea to store amounts of money as floats as all kind of funny things can
    happen. But as openpyxl parses currency cell values as int or float we have
    to work with it anyway.

    Depending on the user input in the Excel file. The input float can have any
    number of decimal places. The value is rounded according to the number of
    minor units of the given currency and then converted to an integer.

    To define a money field in your model you first have to define the currency
    you like to use. For this subclass the Money class and set some class
    variables:

    ```
    class Euro(Money):
        minor_unit = 2
        code = "â‚¬"
        code_before_amount = False
        delimiter = ","
        thousands_separator = "."
    ```

        unit. 1 means a ratio of 10:1, 2 equals to 100:1 and so on. For example
